Solution :

Brute force approach:

We can itterate through array twice with a nested loop and check the both nums[i] and nums[j] is same or not

Time complexity : O(n^2)
Space complexity : O(1)

Using set :

We know set only contains unique number.We can store all the number in set and check set size with nums arrray size.

Time complexity : O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)

Using map :

We can count number of occurence in map .If any element count greater than 1 return true

Time complexity : O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
